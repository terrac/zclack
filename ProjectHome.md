The mouse button is clicked every second after the mouse is paused.  Doubleclicks, right clicks, etc can be performed through mouse gestures

  * Rotate left - Double Click
  * Rotate right - Right Click
  * Move up and down = toggle left click
  * Move down and up - toggle drag

You start the gesture and it ends when you move back to the original location.

For people who use the computer too much.
